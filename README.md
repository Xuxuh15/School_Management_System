## Features
This school management system uses Node.js and various modules to create a RESTful API that can handle all the necessary functionality for a school management system. During this project, I created endpoints, handled routing, and interacted with a database using MongoDB. I also mplemented security measures such as authentication and authorization to protect the API from unauthorized access.

Incorporated a range of topics including Node.js fundamentals, Express.js, MongoDB, and RESTful API development. In addition, I tested the API using a tool called Postman.


## Technologies
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Postman

## Installation
To install the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
3. Set up a MongoDB database on your local machine or use a cloud service such as MongoDB Atlas
4. Create a `.env` file and add your MongoDB connection string as `MONGO_URI`
5. Run `npm start` to start the server

## Usage
The API provides endpoints for managing schools, students, and teachers. 

To use the API, make requests to the appropriate endpoints using a tool such as Postman or a web browser.

## Testing
To test the API, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm test` to run all tests
2. Use the Postman collection provided in the `tests` directory to run tests against the API endpoints
